This challenge focuses on improving the email filtering system for its customers. You've been provided with a dataset that contains information about emails, with two possible classifications: spam and not spam. The ISP wants you to take this dataset and develop a supervised machine learning (ML) model that will accurately detect spam emails so it can filter them out of its customers' inboxes.

## What lassification_challenge does

In this Challenge, you'll be creating two classification models to fit the provided data, and evaluate which model is more accurate at detecting spam. The models you'll create will be a logistic regression model and a random forest model.
